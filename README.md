# ME 201 University of Wisconsin-Madison

ME 201 Introduction to Mechanical Engineering - code and scripts during my mechanical engineering bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2017-2021).

These scripts are from my ME 201 course under Professor Kristofer Dressler.

These scripts are used on Arduino microcontrollers to run various sensors seen in engineering industries.
